# Easygit

A git wrapper plugin made to replace [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive),
it can be used together with fugitive as commands are disabled by default.

The goal make cleaner code, and be more friendly to user (especially using with
macvim)

## Features

* **Consist behaviour**, command always work in the git directory of current file

* **Be quiet**, no ugly **press any key to continue**, and use dispatch method when
  possible

* **Clean code**, avoid madness hack like errorformat etc.

* **Friendly keymaping**, when enter temporary buffer precess `q` would help you to
  quit, no close window if opened by `edit` command

* **Expose flexible API**, in `autoload/easygit.vim`

* **Works good with other plugins** since filetype is nofile, your mru plugin and
  status line plugin should easily ignore them.

## Commands

Commands are disabled by default, if you want to use them, you have to add

    let g:easygit_enable_command = 1

To your `.vimrc`
